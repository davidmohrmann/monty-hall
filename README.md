# Project Name
Monty Hall Dilemma:

Should I Stay or Should I go?!

## Installation

This python3 program is easy to use. From your terminal, run monty-hall1.py or
monty-hall2.py; the first testing the theory that it is worse to keep your original
choice, the latter, confirming that the switch benefits the player.

## Usage

These programs can be used to confirm the statistics that back up the theory that in
"Monty Hall's Dilemma," it is better to switch your choice after a door is opened
to relieve a losing choice. The option is given to either keep your current selection
or take the other available door.

This program could have been made much more complicated, but according to The
Zen of Python: "Simple is better than complex."
